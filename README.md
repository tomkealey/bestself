A deck of 150 conversation prompts that spark meaningful discussions and strengthen relationships. With the Icebreaker Deck, you’ll:

- Move beyond small talk
- Break down barriers, cultivate connections, and cultivate openness and vulnerability
- Get to know people better across 6 categories: life, random, deep, experience, if you could…, and would you rather...

Perfect to use with friends, coworkers, family, and strangers. Select a card and start sharing.

If, like me, you sometimes struggle to pick a category then this little random category generator build in React has got you covered. It’s super simple. Hit up the site, Press the spacebar and lean in. Check it out [demo](https://pickacard.netlify.app/).
